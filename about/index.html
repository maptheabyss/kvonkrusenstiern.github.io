	<p>Hi! My education background is in Physical Geography, Environmental Geology, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). As a M.Sc. student, I hope to apply my undergraduate background in a new field: oceanography. I want to study the ocean floor. Specifically, I hope to investigate questions in seafloor morphology and sediment processes, and that my research can be used to improve coastal resilience efforts. </p>
	
	<p>I am interested in all things open source, particulary those in geospatial technologies. I'm involved with two open-source geospatial groups: CUGOS and OpenStreetMap. Recently, we've started a maptime meet up in Bellingham, WA. I like cartography, downshill skiing, and rock climbing. I am building this website to serve as a portfolio of my work, thoughts, and antics in academic. and anticipate updating it as I further my education and career.</p>
